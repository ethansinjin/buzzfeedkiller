### FAQ
Will there be a Chrome/Firefox/Opera/IE/Mosaic/Netscape Navigator/AOL version of this extension?

* No. Or at least I won't be the one making it anytime soon. Feel free to make it yourself and pull request this repo.

I installed your extension and now I can't use BuzzFeed.

* That's the point.

OK, but there should be a 'dismiss' button or something.

* No, there shouldn't be. You installed an extension called "BuzzFeed Killer".

But what if I really want to read a BuzzFeed article once in a while?

* Too bad. You won't be able to use BuzzFeed in Safari while this extension is installed.

I find this hilarious and want to give you money.

* I'm not sure why you would want to do that. [Donate to Charity instead.](http://www.redcross.org).
